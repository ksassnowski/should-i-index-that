# Things I forgot to tell you

1. The table has about 6 million rows
2. `column_1` contains only numbers between `1` and `9`
3. The data looks like this:

--- :: number: true, master: title1
:: size: 85
![](output-onlinepngtools_(1).png)

--- :: number: true, master: regular1, transition: (0.50;fade)
![](output-onlinepngtools_(1).png)

## Observations

- The data is **not** evenly distributed
- Almost all of the data clusters around the 7-9 range.

What‚Äôs the **minimum** number of rows this query can select?

--- :: master: regular2, number: true
:: size: 120, theme: InspiredGitHub
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
  FROM table
 WHERE column_1 >= 9;
```

:: size: 120
```
