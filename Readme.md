These are the slides for the talk I gave at the Laracon Worldwide Meetup on
2021-04-28. You can watch a recording of the talk on
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLwVr9ToNIs).

The actual markdown file can be found at
[should-i-index-that.hyper/Contents.md](should-i-index-that.hyper/Contents.md).

I used [Hyperdeck](https://hyperdeck.io/) to create the slides.

All illustrations were drawn by me on a [ReMarkable2](https://remarkable.com/).

For the historgram I used [roughViz.js](https://github.com/jwilber/roughViz).
